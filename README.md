# Install-Counter
### Simple script to note each new installed Entropy
> This script logs each new installation of Entropy Linux \
> It creates unique ID for new installed Entropies, then sends it once over Discord webhook in form:
```bash
# Build: [System Version]
# UUID: [System ID]
# Date & Time
```
> Then deletes itself as is no longer needed

### Disclaimer:
*If I ever wanted any "telemetry" from user, this is it*
